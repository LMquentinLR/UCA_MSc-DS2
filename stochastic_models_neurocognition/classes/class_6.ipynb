    "\n",
    "A **point process** is a random and countable set of points in a space $X$. Usually it is denoted $N$ the point process, $\\mathbb{N}=\\{T_1,...,T_n,...\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Countable** means that one can count it, typically $\\{1, ..., n\\}$ or $\\mathbb{N}$ whereas $\\mathbb{R}$ is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example is when:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "X&\\in\\mathbb{R}\\text{ or }\\mathbb{R}_+\\quad\\text{(point = time (i.e. spike trains))}\\\\\n",
    "X&=\\mathbb{R}^2\\quad\\quad\\quad\\text{(points = position (trees, neurons, etc.))}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Notes:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a given $A\\in X$, $N_A$ is the number of points of $N$ in $A$.\n",
