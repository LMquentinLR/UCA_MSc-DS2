    "### The Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Comptuer architecture is the science and art of **designing computing platforms** (hardware, interface, system SW, and programming model) to **achieve a set of design goals** (highest performance on some workloads, longest battery life at a given form factor, best average perf across known workloads at the best perf/cost ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different platforms, and different goals usually rely on the same fundamentals (in terms of architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, new type of platforms have been created to help handle more efficient workloads in some areas such as data processing in ML (e.g. [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_array), In parallel computer architectures, a **systolic array** is a homogeneous network of tightly coupled data processing units (DPUs) called cells or nodes. Each node or DPU independently computes a partial result as a function of the data received from its upstream neighbors, stores the result within itself and passes it downstream.)\n",

    "> **goal**: to enable better system (faster, cheaper, smaller), new applications, better solution to problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current paradigm shift\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many difficult problems that motivate and cause the shift (e.g. data-intensive applications, power/energy/thermal constraints, complexity, technology scaling, memory bottleneck, security/privacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing problem, aglorithms, and programs/languages driven by users **should inform low-level design** (runtime system (VM, OS, MM), ISA, etc.). "
