    "## 1 - RowHammer, a threat to HW security\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "*RowHammer is a **fault attack** that is the result of the miniaturization process in computer architecture. It arises from physical phenomena. All modules from 2012-2013 are vulnerable due to this.*\n",
    "\n",
    "An **issue**... One can predictably induce bit flips in commodity DRAM chips (80% of tested DRAM chips are vulnerable). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Leading to**... A simple hardware failure mechanism that can create a widespread system security vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "![rw](images/rowhammer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**relies on**: a hammered row and victim rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Conclusion**:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Repeatedly reading a row enough times (before memory gets refreshed) induces distubance errors in adjacent rows in most real DRAM chips. <span style=\"color:red\">RowHammer undermines memory isolation, which is a key property of a reliable and secure computing system</span> (an access to one memory address should not have unintended side effects on data stored in other addresses).\n",
    "\n",
    "### RowHammer in 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects of RowHammer have increased. Mitigation does not work as expected, i.e., newer DRAM chips are more vulnerable to RowHammer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Solution: BlockHammer\n",
    "\n",
    "Relies on blacklisting rapidly-accessed DRAM rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "RowHammer is still a problem and security by obscurity is likely not a good solution."

    "> A memory access consumes c. 100-1000x the energy of a complex addition\n",

    "> A floating point 64-bit operation takes 20picojoules while a DRAM rd/wr operation takes 16 nanojoules.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. **Communication dominates arithmetic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This domination was inverted in the past. In the early stages of computing arithmetic was expensive, however miniaturization inverted this relationship since then. Transistor technology scaling exploded compared to memory technology."
