    "## 1 - Memory and Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "The issues discussed here are similar between cache, memory and storage, i.e. memory in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is memory so important (especially today)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of main memory. **4 perspectives**:\n",
    "- security \n",
    "- energy\n",
    "- scaling, reliability, security\n",
    "- trends, challenges, opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "The main memory is a **critical component of all computing systems**. The main issue of the main memory is that main memory system must scale (size, tech, efficiency, cost, management algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the system is dedicated to storing and moving data (a shared resource view).\n",
    "\n",
    "### State of the Main Memory System\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent tech, arch, and applications trends lead to new requirements and exacerbate old requirements. **DRAM and memory controllers are unlikely to satisfy all requirements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some emerging non-volatile memory tech enable new opportunities (merging of memory and storage). \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to rethink the main meory system to fix the DRAM issues and enable emerging techs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Major trends\n",
    "\n",
    "DRAM capacity has increased by 128x+ since 1999, DRAM bandwidth by 20x+, and latency by 1.3x+.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Need for main memory capacity, bandwidth, quality of service must increase**: multi-core (DRAM DIMM capacity doubling happens slower than core-count doubling, i.e. **<span style=\"color:red\">memory capacity gap</span>**), data-intensive applications, consolidation (cloud computing, GPU, mobile, heterogeneity)\n",
    "2. **Energy/power is a key design concern**: more than 62.7% of the total system energy is spent on data movement (lots of waste)\n",
    "3. **DRAM tech scaling is ending**: DRAM will not scale easily below some nanometer size (leak risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "### DRAM Scaling Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "DRAM stores charge in a capacity (Charge-based memory). Capacity must be large enough for reliable sensing. Access transistor should be large enough for low leakage and high retention time (beyond 40-35nm, it's hard). \n",
    "\n",
    "![dram](images/DRAM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "DRAM capacity, cost, and energy/power is hard to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Placing and controling charge is hard. Data retention and reliable sensing becomes difficult as charge storage unit size reduces. Furthermore **relative server failure rates** have increased as memory scales -- it becomes **unreliable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| new type | advantage | disadvantage | \n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 3d stacked DRAM | higher bandwith | smaller capacity | \n",
    "| Reduced-latency DRAM | lower latency | higher cost |\n",
    "| Low-Power DRAM | lower power | higher latency and cost | \n",
    "| Non-Volatile Memory | larger capacity | higher latency, dynamic power, lower endurance | \n",
    "\n",
    "These trade-offs lead to development of hybrid main memory that mix hardware and softare to manage data allocation and movement to achieve the best of multiple technologies.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal is to make memory and controllers more intelligent to try and eliminate or minimize the memory problem (replace or augment DRAM with a different technology).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that the solution relies in heterogeneous memories that map data intelligently across subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### New Memory Architctures\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be possible to overcome memory shortcomings with memory-centric system design, novel memory architectures, interfaces, and functions, as well as a better waste management.\n",

    "### Key issues to tackle\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enable reliability at low cost -> high capacity\n",
    "- reduce energy\n",
    "- reduce latency\n",
    "- improve bandwidth\n",
    "- reduce waste (Capacity, bandwidth, latency)\n",
    "- enable computation close to data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resistive memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Some emerging resistive memory technologies seem more scalable than DRAM (e.g. phase change memory). The data is stored by changing the phase of the material, and read by detecting its resistence. It is expected to scale to 9nm and to be denser than DRAM.\n",

    "### Exploiting the memory error tolerance with hybrid memory systems\n",

    "One across-the-stack solution would characterize and classify application memory error tolerence and map application data to the HRM system enabled by SW/HW coopoerative solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good fit for deep neural networks."
